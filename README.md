# 9-11-2001-DiachronicAnalysis-Project

The historical period in which we live is subject to many cultural, social but also linguistic changes.
In this Data Semantics project, me and the other group members (@DanielePoterti and @alessiosanvito) used word embeddings to create a diachronic analysis about words related to a specific event. 

In our analysis we decided to explore the diachronic change of the facts regarding this topic (9/11 attacks) over time, analyzing the period before, during and after 2001.
To do so we used the 'Newspaper' section of the corpus COCA (https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/)
